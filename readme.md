## Description:
    This is a landing page for a company in which we [the students] had to refactor the code for.

## Refactor:
    Making sure the code read well by changing elements semantically.

## HTML:
    Many elements that were previously "div" tags were renamed to more appropriate tags for better readability and accessibility.

## CSS:
    Selectors like the h4 tag were introduced to improve readability.
